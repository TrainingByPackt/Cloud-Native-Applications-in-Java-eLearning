# Cloud-Native-Applications-in-Java
Cloud-native applications in java is your one-stop guide to building cloud-native applications in Java Spring that are hosted on AWS and Azure. This course teaches you everything you need to build secure, robust, and scalable microservice-based applications and deploy them into the cloud. 	 

## What you will learn
* Create Docker containers for microservices and set up continuous integration with Jenkins
* Monitor and troubleshoot applications in the cloud
* Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerization
* Perform log aggregation and visualization with the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack
* Explore a variety of XaaS APIs and build your own XaaS model
* Migrate from a monolithic architecture to a cloud-native deployment


### Hardware requirements
For an optimal experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel i5 (or equivalent)
* **Memory**: 8GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 10 GB
